# 🎬 Video Magic - Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Error: "Erreur lors de la sauvegarde de la vidéo générée"
**Root Cause**: Two issues:
- Supabase bucket `output-videos` might not exist
- Azure Sora video download URL returned 404

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging throughout the pipeline
- ✅ Added Api-key header to video download request
- ✅ Converted ArrayBuffer to Uint8Array for Supabase upload
- ✅ Added 5-second delay after job completion before download attempt
- ✅ Improved error messages with detailed context
- ✅ Added signed URL fallback if public URL fails

### 2. ❌ Links showing "Resource not found"
**Root Cause**: 
- Supabase buckets didn't exist OR
- Bucket not public OR  
- Wrong Supabase project (wrong env vars)

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Created improved SQL schema with bucket creation
- ✅ Added logging to show which Supabase URL is being used
- ✅ Added signed URL generation as fallback

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/api/generate/route.ts`
**Changes**:
- Added detailed logging for each step (📥 download, 📤 upload, 🔗 URL generation, 💾 database)
- Added `Api-key` header to video download from Sora
- Better error handling with specific error messages
- Log buffer sizes, response status codes, and headers
- Show Supabase configuration in error logs

### 2. `lib/sora.ts`
**Changes**:
- Extract base URL dynamically from AZURE_SORA_ENDPOINT
- Added 5-second wait after job succeeds (gives Azure time to prepare video)
- Enhanced `fetchGenerationContent` to try metadata endpoint first
- Check multiple possible URL fields in responses
- More comprehensive endpoint attempts
- Better logging for troubleshooting

### 3. `supabase-schema-improved.sql` (New File)
**Features**:
- Complete database schema with proper constraints
- Automatic `updated_at` trigger
- Indexes for performance
- Email validation for waiting list
- Bucket creation with public access
- All necessary RLS policies
- Storage policies for both buckets
- Verification query at the end

### 4. `AZURE_SORA_VIDEO_DOWNLOAD_FIX.md` (New File)
**Content**:
- Comprehensive diagnostic guide
- Explanation of the 404 issue
- Testing commands (PowerShell & curl)
- Multiple solution options
- Troubleshooting steps
- Temporary workaround suggestions

## Setup Requirements

### Supabase Configuration

**CRITICAL**: You must create the Supabase buckets before the app will work.

#### Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/bodpqqoqrwzlscziflzt
2. Go to **Storage** → **Buckets**
3. Click **New bucket**
4. Create bucket #1:
   - Name: `input-images`
   - ✅ Check **Public bucket**
   - Click **Create bucket**
5. Create bucket #2:
   - Name: `output-videos`
   - ✅ Check **Public bucket**  
   - Click **Create bucket**

#### Option B: Via SQL
1. Go to **SQL Editor** in Supabase
2. Copy and paste entire content of `supabase-schema-improved.sql`
3. Click **Run**
4. Check the verification output at bottom

### Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in `.env.local`:

```env
# Azure Sora
AZURE_API_KEY=your-azure-api-key
AZURE_SORA_ENDPOINT=https://bapti-m70vyuu5-eastus2.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/video/generations/jobs?api-version=preview

# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=https://bodpqqoqrwzlscziflzt.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

**⚠️ Important**: Make sure you're using the **service role key** (not anon key) for `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

## Testing

### Verify Supabase Buckets

```powershell
$headers = @{
  'apikey' = $env:SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
  'Authorization' = "Bearer $env:SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
}
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$env:SUPABASE_URL/storage/v1/buckets" -Headers $headers | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5
```

**Expected output**: Should show both `input-images` and `output-videos` buckets.

### Run the App

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Then go to http://localhost:3000 and:
1. Upload an image
2. Enter a prompt
3. Click generate
4. Watch the terminal logs (now much more detailed!)

### What the Logs Will Show

With the enhanced logging, you'll see:

```
🎬 Sora - Creating video generation job...
🎬 Sora - Job created with ID: task_xxx
🎬 Sora - Poll attempt 1/60
🎬 Sora - Job status: preprocessing
...
🎬 Sora - Job status: succeeded
🎬 Sora - Job succeeded! Waiting for video to be fully ready...
🎬 Sora - Fetching generation metadata...

🔗 Public URL retrieved: https://xxx.supabase.co/...
💾 Saving project to database...
✅ Project saved to database
✅ Generation complete!
```

## Known Issues & Next Steps

### If video download still fails with 404:

**Possible causes**:
1. **Azure Sora preview API limitation**: The preview API might not support direct download
2. **Additional delay needed**: 5 seconds might not be enough
3. **Different API version needed**: Check if there's a GA (non-preview) version
4. **Azure Storage integration required**: Azure might expect you to configure blob storage output

**Recommended actions**:
1. ✅ Try the app with the 5-second delay (already implemented)
2. Check Azure Sora documentation for video download procedure
3. Try increasing delay to 10-15 seconds if needed
4. Contact Azure support if issue persists
5. Consider implementing background job approach (see `AZURE_SORA_VIDEO_DOWNLOAD_FIX.md`)

### If Supabase upload fails:

**Error**: `Bucket not found`
- ✅ Run `supabase-schema-improved.sql` to create buckets
- ✅ Verify buckets exist using command above
- ✅ Check that `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` match your project

**Error**: `Access denied` or `Unauthorized`
- ✅ Make sure you're using service role key, not anon key
- ✅ Check RLS policies (script creates them automatically)
- ✅ Verify storage policies exist

## Build Verification

✅ **TypeScript compilation passes**:
```powershell
npm run build
```

Result: All files compile successfully with no errors.

## Summary

### What We Did:
1. ✅ Added comprehensive logging to trace execution
2. ✅ Fixed video download to include API key header
3. ✅ Added delay after job completion for video availability
4. ✅ Improved error handling and messages
5. ✅ Created proper database schema with bucket setup
6. ✅ Added signed URL fallback for private buckets
7. ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors
8. ✅ Created diagnostic and troubleshooting guides

### What You Need to Do:
1. **Create Supabase buckets** (follow instructions above) - **REQUIRED**
2. **Test the app** and check the detailed logs
3. **Report back** what you see in logs (especially the video download step)
4. If 404 persists, we can try alternative solutions from the diagnostic guide

### Files to Review:
- `supabase-schema-improved.sql` - Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
- `AZURE_SORA_VIDEO_DOWNLOAD_FIX.md` - Read if video download issues persist
- Terminal logs when running the app - Will show detailed step-by-step progress

---

**Next Actions**: Create the Supabase buckets and test the app. The enhanced logging will help us diagnose any remaining issues quickly!
